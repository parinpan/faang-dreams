# faang-dreams

Faang Dreams is a reflection Github repository for me to keep unlearning things that should be considered as basic knowledge in computer science. I hope by its existence I would be doing better in competitive programming and able to conquer one of the FAANG company.

# what is FAANG actually?
Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (FAANG), a further extension of FANG (which originally did not include Apple), is both an acronym and a buzzword to entice investors. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Apple,_Amazon,_Netflix_and_Google
